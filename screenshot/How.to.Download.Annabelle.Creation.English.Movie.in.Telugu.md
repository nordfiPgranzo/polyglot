## What Critics and Audiences Say About Annabelle Creation
 
Annabelle Creation received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its direction, atmosphere, performances, and scares. It has a 70% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Annabelle: Creation adds another strong chapter to the Conjuring franchise - and offers further proof that freaky-looking dolls remain reliably terrifying." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". On IMDb, the film has a rating of 6.5 out of 10, based on 122,000 user votes.
 
Some critics highlighted the film's improvement over its predecessor, Annabelle, which was widely panned as a dull and uninspired cash-grab. Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert.com wrote, "It used to be a pretty reliable rule of moviedom that sequels to inferior horror films were even more worthless than the original. After all, how do you build on nothing? Last yearâs âOuija: Origin of Evilâ was widely and correctly considered superior to the dull original, and 2017 repeats that shocking trick with âAnnabelle: Creation,â a vast improvement over the monstrously awful âAnnabelleâ from 2014."
 
Other critics praised the film's visual style, suspenseful sequences, and effective use of sound and music. Tara Brady of The Irish Times wrote, "For the first two acts, while Annabelle: Creation concerns itself with little girls checking under beds and investigating things that go bump in the night, it's equal to James Wan's Conjuring films." Adam Graham of The Detroit News wrote, "Sandberg knows how to stage a scare, using sound effects and music to build tension and jolt his audience."
 
However, some critics found the film's plot predictable, clichÃ©d, and lacking in originality. Jake Wilson of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, "Sometimes a creepy-looking doll is just a creepy-looking doll and no amount of repetition can make the sweet old song You Are My Sunshine even the slightest bit scary." Adam Nayman of The Ringer wrote, "The film exists simply to get us somewhere we've already been, and so the level of invention in the storytelling declines right when it should be ramping up."
