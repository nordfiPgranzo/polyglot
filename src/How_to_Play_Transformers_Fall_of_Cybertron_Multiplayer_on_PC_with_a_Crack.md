The game was released in 2012 for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later ported to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016. However, the game was delisted from digital platforms in 2017 due to licensing issues, making it hard to find a legitimate copy of the game online. Moreover, the official multiplayer servers were shut down in 2020, leaving fans of the game with no option to play online with other players.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to play Transformers: Fall of Cybertron multiplayer on PC with a crack, thanks to the Transformers: ReEnergized discord project. This project aims to revive the online multiplayer mode of both Transformers: War for Cybertron and Transformers: Fall of Cybertron by using a custom launcher and dedicated servers. The project supports both official and cracked versions of the game, so you don't need to buy the game to join the fun.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download, install, and crack Transformers: Fall of Cybertron on PC, and how to set up multiplayer using the Transformers: ReEnergized launcher. Follow these steps carefully and you will be able to enjoy one of the best Transformers games ever made with other fans around the world.
 
## Step 1: Download the Game Files
 
The first step is to download the clean Steam files for Transformers: Fall of Cybertron from this link[^1^]. This is a RAR file containing the original files from Steam, with all of the DLCs included. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files. Extract them to any location on your disk, preferably a folder named "Transformers Fall of Cybertron".
 
This step is optional, but you could make an exception to your anti-virus for this folder. Sometimes Windows overreacts to pre-installed programs and might prevent you from launching the game. It's possible that you can still leave your anti-virus running without making an exception and it'll work fine, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
 
## Step 2: Download and Apply the Crack
 
The next step is to download the crack files from this link[^2^]. This is a ZIP file containing the files needed to run the game without Steam. You will need to extract these files to the following location: Transformers Fall of Cybertron/steamapps/common/Transformers Fall of Cybertron/Binaries. Replace any of the original files when extracting.
 
Once you have done that, you can launch the game by clicking on TransformersFOC.exe in that folder. The game should start without any problems. You can also create a shortcut of this file on your desktop for easy access.
 
## Step 3: Download and Install the Transformers: ReEnergized Launcher
 
The final step is to download and install the Transformers: ReEnergized launcher from this link[^3^]. This is an executable file that will install a custom launcher for Transformers: Fall of Cybertron on your PC. Run this file and follow the instructions on screen. You will need to select your game folder (the one where you extracted the Steam files) and your username.
 
Once you have installed the launcher, you can run it by clicking on ReEnergized.exe in your game folder. The launcher will check for updates and then show you a list of available servers. You can join any server by double-clicking on it or by clicking on Join Server at the bottom right corner. You can also create your own server by clicking on Host Server at the bottom left corner.
 
The launcher will automatically launch the game and connect you to the server. You can then enjoy playing Transformers: Fall of Cybertron multiplayer with other players online. You can also chat with other players using the Discord
